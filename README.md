# ManifoldCSG for Unity

Boolean mesh operations (subtract, union, intersect) for Unity at runtime. Objects can be changed
repeatedly, e.g. by a weapon that cuts a hole with every hit. The geometry is computed by
[Manifold](https://github.com/elalish/manifold), included as a native plugin.

## Requirements

- Unity 6 (tested with 6000.5). The demos use URP and the Input System package; without the Input System
  package their scripts are not compiled.
- macOS (arm64 and x86_64) and Windows x64, Editor and Standalone.
- Android (ARM64, ARMv7 and x86_64, API 23+) and iOS (ARM64 devices, iOS 13+).
  iOS Simulator, Linux and WebGL libraries are not provided.
- Meshes must be closed (every edge shared by exactly two triangles) and have Read/Write enabled.
  Unity's Cube, Sphere, Cylinder and Capsule meshes work, the Plane does not.

## Installation

Either through the Package Manager: *Window > Package Manager > + > Install package from git URL*, then

```
https://github.com/icosa-mirror/manifold-csg-unity.git
```

Or clone the repository into the `Assets` folder of your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/icosa-mirror/manifold-csg-unity.git Assets/ManifoldCSG
```

Use git either way. If the repository is downloaded as a ZIP file instead, macOS may block the native
library with a security warning.

## Mobile native libraries

Mobile libraries and their Unity importer settings are included under `Plugins/Android/` and
`Plugins/iOS/`. No separate download is needed when installing this fork.

The **Build mobile native plugins** GitHub Actions workflow rebuilds Android and iOS libraries from
Manifold v3.5.3. It runs when native build inputs change and can also be run manually from the
repository's Actions tab. To update the bundled binaries:

1. Run the workflow in your fork and download the `mobile-native-plugins` artifact.
2. Extract its `Plugins/` folder into this package's root, keeping the `.meta` files. For a package
   installed through a Git URL, add the files to your fork and commit them, then update the package
   revision in Unity; Package Manager's cached copies are read-only.
3. Select the matching target architecture in Unity's Player Settings. Android has ARM64, ARMv7 and
   x86_64 libraries; iOS has a device-only ARM64 static archive.

The Android library includes Manifold, Clipper2 and the C++ runtime and supports 16 KB memory pages.
The iOS archive includes Manifold and Clipper2, links with Apple's C++ runtime, and uses
`DllImport("__Internal")` in device players. Desktop Editors continue to use their existing library.
The workflow checks that every C API entry point used by the C# bindings is present. Device runtime
testing is still required; these checks do not run Unity players.

For local rebuild commands and prerequisites, see [Native~/README.md](Native~/README.md).

## Usage

1. Add a `CsgBody` component to the object you want to change.
2. Create a tool: *Create > ManifoldCSG > CSG Shape*.
3. Apply the tool from a script:

```csharp
using ManifoldCSG;
using UnityEngine;

public class SimpleGun : MonoBehaviour
{
    public CsgShape bullet;
    public float size = 0.3f;

    public void Fire(Ray ray)
    {
        RaycastHit hit;
        if (!Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit)) return;
        CsgBody body = hit.collider.GetComponent<CsgBody>();
        if (body == null) return;

        // CSG Shape primitives are unit size, +Y points out of the surface
        Quaternion rotation = Quaternion.FromToRotation(Vector3.up, hit.normal);
        Matrix4x4 toolToWorld = Matrix4x4.TRS(hit.point, rotation, Vector3.one * size);
        body.Subtract(bullet, toolToWorld);
    }
}
```

## CsgBody

Component for objects that are changed repeatedly. The mesh is imported on the first operation; until
then the object is left as it is.

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Interior Material | Material of faces cut into the body. Empty: same as the outside. |
| Normals | Recalculate from the geometry, or keep the mesh's imported normals. |
| Sharp Angle | Recalculate only: edges sharper than this angle stay hard. |
| Colliders | Auto, Exact, Convex or Keep, see [Colliders](#colliders). |
| Scale Mass With Volume | Scales the Rigidbody's mass with the remaining volume. |
| When Empty | Destroy, deactivate or keep the object when nothing is left. |

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `Subtract`, `Union`, `Intersect` | Take a `CsgShape` and a matrix, a `Mesh` and a matrix, or a `MeshFilter` (uses its transform). Return `false` on failure; the body is then unchanged. |
| `Apply(operation, ...)` | Same as above with a `CsgOperation` value. |
| `LastError` | Reason for the last failure. |
| `ResetShape()` | Restores the original mesh, materials, colliders and mass. |
| `InteriorMaterial` | Can be changed at runtime. |
| `Operations`, `IsEmpty`, `Volume`, `TriangleCount` | Current state. |
| `Changed` | Event after every change. |

## CSG Shape

Asset that defines a tool. It can be used by any number of bodies.

- Primitive: sphere, box, cylinder or cone, unit size (fits a 1 × 1 × 1 box), +Y points out of the surface.
  Segments sets the circle resolution.
- Mesh: any closed mesh, at its own size, pivot as origin.
- Material: optional, see [Materials](#materials).
- `PreviewMesh`: a Unity mesh of the shape, e.g. for a preview.

Each cut adds about half of the tool's triangles to the body. Use low resolutions for repeated cuts
(8 to 16 segments for bullet holes).

## Materials

- Faces keep the material of the mesh or submesh they came from.
- Faces created by Subtract and Intersect get the body's Interior Material.
- Faces created by Union get the body's first material.
- If a CSG Shape has a Material, its faces always get that material.

Cut faces have no UVs. Use untextured interior materials.

## Colliders

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Auto | Exact; Convex with a non-kinematic Rigidbody; nothing if the object has no collider. |
| Exact | Non-convex MeshCollider of the current shape. Raycasts and physics see the holes. |
| Convex | Convex MeshCollider of the current shape. Works with dynamic Rigidbodies; holes are filled. |
| Keep | Colliders are not changed. |

With Exact and Convex, the first operation reuses an existing MeshCollider or adds one, and disables the
other non-trigger colliders. `ResetShape` restores them.

## One-shot operations

`Csg` combines two meshes once, without a component. The result is a new mesh in the local space of the
first object. Both meshes are imported on every call.

```csharp
Mesh result = Csg.Subtract(workpiece, cutter);       // MeshFilters; also Union, Intersect
if (result != null) workpiece.sharedMesh = result;

Mesh split = Csg.Subtract(workpiece, cutter, true);  // cut faces in an extra submesh

string message;
if (!Csg.Check(mesh, out message)) Debug.Log(message);
```

## Low-level API

`Manifold` wraps a native Manifold object, `ManifoldUnity` converts between `Manifold` and
`UnityEngine.Mesh`. Each `Manifold` holds native memory and must be disposed.

```csharp
using (Manifold work = ManifoldUnity.FromUnityMesh(meshFilter.sharedMesh))
using (Manifold raw = Manifold.Sphere(0.4, 32))
using (Manifold sphere = raw.CalculateNormals(50))
using (Manifold hole = ManifoldUnity.Transform(sphere, Matrix4x4.Translate(new Vector3(0.5f, 0, 0))))
using (Manifold result = work.Boolean(hole, CsgOperation.Subtract))
{
    meshFilter.mesh = ManifoldUnity.ToUnityMesh(result.GetMeshData(null, 0));
}
```

Further operations: `Hull`, `Split`, `Decompose`, `Batch`, `TrimByPlane`, `Volume`, `GetBounds`.
`Manifold` does not use the Unity API and can run on other threads. `CsgBody`, `Csg` and the mesh
conversions must run on the main thread.

## Performance

Cost grows with the triangle count of the body. 8 m wall, 12-segment sphere, Apple Silicon:

| Hits | 1-10 | 50 | 100 | 150 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Triangles | < 1k | ~5k | ~10k | ~15k |
| Exact collider | 0.5 ms | 3 ms | 6 ms | 9 ms |
| Keep collider | 0.3 ms | 2 ms | 4 ms | 5 ms |

Profiler markers: `CsgBody.Apply`, `CsgBody.UpdateMesh`, `CsgBody.UpdateCollider`.

## Limitations

- Cut faces have no UVs and no tangents.
- A tool face that lies exactly in the body's surface leaves a thin skin instead of an opening.
- Errors inside the native library crash the Editor. Inputs are validated before they are passed on.

## Samples

In `Demo/` (assembly `ManifoldCSG.Demo`, compiled only with the Input System package):

- `CsgDemo`: Union, Subtract and Intersect, each applied every frame with a moving sphere.
- `CsgCarving`: click to cut a tool shape out of an object. Right mouse button orbits, wheel zooms.

Packages installed with the Package Manager are read-only, so Unity cannot open these scenes there.
Copy a scene into `Assets` (e.g. duplicate it with Ctrl+D or drag it there) and open the copy. This will
be fixed in a later version.
